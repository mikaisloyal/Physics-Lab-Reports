# Physics Lab Reports Archive

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of my physics lab reports completed as part of my coursework at the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT). These reports cover a range of foundational experiments in classical mechanics, electricity, and waves.

I decided to share them in hopes that they might help fellow students understand core physics concepts, build better lab documentation skills, or simply find inspiration.

## 🔬 List of Experiments

- **Experimental Determination of Resistivity in Metal Wires**
- **Analysis of Binary and Ternary Capacitor Combinations**
- **Experimental Determination of the Vacuum Permittivity Using a Parallel Plate Capacitor**
- **Electric Field Line Mapping**
- **Measuring the Speed of a Wave**
- **Evaluating the Spring Constant of Parallel and Series Spring Combinations**
- **Evaluating the Spring Constant Using Static and Dynamic Methods**
- **Determining the Initial Velocity of a Projectile Using Kinetic Equation and Ballistic Pendulum**
- **Experimental Verification of Mechanical Energy Conservation Using an Air Track and Cart**
- **Estimation of the Kinetic Frictional Coefficient Between the Air Track and Cart**
